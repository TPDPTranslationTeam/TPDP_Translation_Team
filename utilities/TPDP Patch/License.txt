By installing this patch, you understand and agree that you obtained a copy of the base game, Gensou Ningyou Enbu, as well as the expansion, Yume no Kakera, through legitimate retailers. If you have obtained the copy illegitimately, this patch will make your computer start insulting your waifu and calling her an irrelevant character only liked by secondaries. Please, preserve your waifu's integrity! We highly suggest you support the developers by obtaining the game from the Melonbooks website (http://www.melonbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=IT0000177135). A guide on how to navigate Melonbooks's website exists on the forum, and is linked to on the wiki for easy finding. 

Also, please understand that this patch is distributed and brought to you for free by the Touhou Puppet Play Community and its associated forums (http://thpp.supersanctuary.net/forum/index.php). If you've paid for this patch and its translation at all, you've been hoodwinked! We cannot reimburse you if you paid for this patch, and you will have to go about handling that yourself.

This is a derivative work of the Touhou Project series of games and subsequent works produced by Team Shanghai Alice and Tasogare Frontier. Depictions within the game do not entirely represent the depictions of the actual canonical material (characters, settings, etc.). Credit for this game goes to the doujin circle FocasLens.

Disclaimer: This translation patch is not affiliated with FocasLens or Team Shanghai Alice. This patch does not and should not cause unrecoverable damage. By installing this patch you agree that if you mess something up it is your fault and not the fault of FocasLens, Team Shanghai Alice, or the Touhou Puppet Play Community. We will however be offering some support on our forums. Although the patch will attempt to create backups of the original and unedited files, it is recommended that you create your own backup before patching in the slim chance that something does go wrong.
