So you are the one that everyone has
been talking about...\b
\x00
Ah!.. Excuse me.\b
\x03
Allow me to introduce myself. I am Akyuu, the head
of the Hieda family.\b
\x00
I've read about you in the Tengu's special
issues.\b
It seems you are quite talented in
manipulating Puppets...\b
\x04
I see. Sanae told you to meet me here, yes?\b
\x00
Hmm... So you are investigating the Puppets
incident so you could find your way home?\b
\x02
To be honest with you, I have very little
knowledge regarding the incident as well.\b
The only thing we know so far is that Puppets
can only be dealt with by other Puppets.\b
\x01
We have been able to defend the Village after we
discovered Puppet Sealing methods,\b
but it doesn't solve the root of the problem.\b
\x00
Please enjoy your time here in the village while
we continue to research the matter.\b
We will inform you when we make progress in
our research.\b
\x03
We don't have anything remarkable,\b
but I bet you will find something that
is very special to you and your world.
