This is the Capital that was forgotten long ago.\b
But I don't care about that, I'll be here laughing until the end!\b
Come on, enjoy yourself!\b

//i don't like the hell translations they're confusing end me

//ここは忘れ去られた都 旧都。\b
//でも ここの奴らぁんなこと気にせず心底楽しそうに笑ってるのさ。\b
//さぁさ あんたも楽しんでおいき。\b
//\cあん？あんたが何者なんか聞きやしないよ。酒かっくらえば全員同じさ。
