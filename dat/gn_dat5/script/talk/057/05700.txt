... Ayayaya!\b

You're the well known \p that I heard of right?\b
How unexpected to meet you here.\b
\x00
Are you perhaps heading toward Youkai Mountain?\b
How impressive.
You truly are different from other humans.\b
\x03
Youkai Mountain is nice!\b
We have the Kappa Hideout at the mountain base, Tengu Village in the middle, and the Moriya Shrine at the summit. The mountain is also great for sightseeing!\b
\x01
There's also a rumor of a hermit retreat being somewhere on the mountain...
