Oh, so you do know about it.\b
The revived Liberation Front has been
running wild in many places.\b

A-And that's really bad!\b
\x01
That has nothing to do with us, you know?\b
That person is just using our name to do
whatever they want!\b
Most of all, they're doing really bad things
too!!\b

That's why we thought to punish that bad
person!\b
\x04
Huh...?
They're doing the same thing that we did?\b
\x01
That's rude! We weren't stealing those other
people's Puppets!\b

But our important leader, Medicine, is
nowhere to be found.\b
We can't restart our activities without her.\b
\x01
Medicine is our leader after all.\b
Without her, we can't do anything!\b
\oSunny Milk
\j69_01
That's why we want you to look for her!\b
This is an order from your substitute
leader!\b

The idea of Sunny being the leader makes me
uneasy, but is it alright if we leave this
to you?\b

\p is the one who put a stop to
our pranks after all.\b
It should go smoothly.\b
\x00
Yup yup.
Since this is Medicine, she should hopefully
not be away from Suzuran Field.\b
\x03
We want you go to help Rumia and co. look
for her there.\b

We'll leave this to you now!
