On the way to that mountain, the Puppet Liberation Front returned. I beat them up and got a boat.\b
Then it was back to climbing the mountain. Thanks to the boat, I could ignore the stairs.\b
\cThe Hakurei Shrine Maiden found me again. The only thing that I learned is that Salvo is disgusting.\b
I got this weird map with eyes all over it in a destroyed village.\b
\cSince there was nothing else to be learned about the incident, I'll just move on.
I hate retracing my steps, but I might have to do that.\b

But why would they bother using all of these books to write only this in...?
