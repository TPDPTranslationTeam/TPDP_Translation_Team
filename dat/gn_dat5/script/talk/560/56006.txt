\cThat third world? Apparently, it's right
behind the Hakurei Shrine and is called
Makai.\b
\cWhich sounds ridiculous. I would've noticed

try to find it.\b
\cThere was also a door down there, but I
don't know how to open it. This is the new
30-centimeter-tall shrub.\b

It's just a fairy tale though.
It's not real.
