All of this felt like a long dream.\b
I went on a journey with magical Puppets in
a magical world with magical people.\b
\cI hated it at first, but now I wish it
didn't end.\b
\cI keep feeling this loneliness now that the
one Puppet is gone...\b
\cBut which of them will I forget...?\b
I want to return. I want to see them again.
And I don't want to wake up this time.\b
\cAfter all, that one Puppet... it was pretty
cute.\b No\b, they were the cutest.\b
