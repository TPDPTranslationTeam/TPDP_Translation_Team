Apparently I've entered Gensokyo somehow.\b
\cI also can't go home. That's just great.
Not until I resolve this "Puppet" incident, that is.\b
\cI've been told to go over to the Human Village. Seems like that's the only way to begin.\b

This seems to be someone's diary.\b
Seeing how a similar event's mentioned in it, I think it could be related to the Puppet incident.\b

Even then, how does entering Gensokyo like they did work?
