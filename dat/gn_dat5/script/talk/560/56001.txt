As I left the village, I was told off by the Hakurei Shrine Maiden.
Apparently when there's an incident, she's kind of a jerk, just like everyone says.\b
\cIn the forest, I met a Pupp... no, a doll-controlling this time, magician.
I don't really believe what she's telling me, so this is probably a waste.\b
\cBut thanks to her, I have a new destination: the Scarlet Devil Mansion.
The only problem is this 30-centimeter-tall impassable shrub. I even tried burning it to no avail.\b

The Hakurei Shrine Maiden is Reimu.\b
Seeing how she warned them, maybe the author was involved in an incident?\b

Reimu sure is scary when angry.
