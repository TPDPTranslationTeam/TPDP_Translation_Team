As I left the village, I was told off by
the Hakurei Shrine Maiden.\b
\cApparently, when there's an incident, she's
kind of a jerk, just like everyone says.\b
\cIn the forest, I met a Pupp... no, this
time, a doll-controlling magician.\b
\cI don't really believe what she's telling
me, so this is probably a waste.\b
\cBut thanks to her, I have a new
destination: the Scarlet Devil Mansion.\b
\cThe only problem is this 30-centimeter-tall
impassable shrub. I even tried burning it
to no avail.\b

The Hakurei Shrine Maiden is Reimu.\b
Seeing how she warned them, maybe the
author was involved in an incident?\b

Reimu sure is scary when angry.
