When I woke up, I was at the Hakurei Shrine again.\b
I was knocked out for what seemed like forever, but the Shrine Maiden looked after me.\b
\cThe Puppets actually seem to be disappearing... I resolved the incident!
The barrier hasn't re-opened yet, but I'll be able to return soon.\b
\cThat's great, but... the Puppets kinda grew on me through this whole thing.\b
Maybe I should play with them a bit more... I don't want them to be lonely, too.\b

Seems like the story is about to end.
Now I feel lonely.
