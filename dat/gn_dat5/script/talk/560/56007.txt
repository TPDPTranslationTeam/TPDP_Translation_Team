Well, I found another unexpected town, even by the underground's standards.\b
This one's more modern than Gensokyo, though, that's for sure.\b
\cI was also expecting scary monsters, not nice sprites. Everyone's actually peaceful.
Which makes it the only possible place that an incident like this would begin from.\b
\cThere are special Puppets here too that I hadn't seen yet, so more points to that theory.\b
Time to infiltrate that giant castle and resolve this incident.\b

Did anyone go to Makai other than you?\b

Maybe you wrote it, \p?\b

Yeah, I didn't think so either!
