An old-looking leaflet is on the ground.\b
\c       Ancient Relics 'Fantasy Ruins'\b
             Opening today at 10\b
\c"For those who visit the ruins, I'll give 
you something that'll make you happy.\b 
I am waiting warmly for you to visit my 
shop."\b
\c... is what is written.\b
These leaflets are quite suspicious.
