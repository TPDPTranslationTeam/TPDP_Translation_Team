It's finally here; I've been waiting for this!\b
Thanks, you've really helped me out.\b
\x00
Huh? About the Puppets?\b
That reminds me, you're that human child that made it into the newspaper.\b
\x01
Hmm... It's as\p says.\b 
\x02
Unfortunately, I don't have any information either.\b
I'm so sorry that I'm not able to help you out.\b
\x00
Oh, right, \p.\b
You must be really tired after coming all the way out here, right?\b
\x03
Since you'll be heading back on the same road, you should rest here for a little bit.\b
