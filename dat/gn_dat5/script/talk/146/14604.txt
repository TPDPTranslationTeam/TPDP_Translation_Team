Fufu sorry for waking you up from your usual sleep okay?\b
\x00
It's been a while.\b
I watched you playing an active role.\b
\x03
Bringing you along was a good thing.\b
\x01
However, Gensokyo is a very wide and expansive place.\b
There are many places you've not visited and places that have changed too.\b
\x00
When you wake, maybe it'd be a good idea to travel around more.\b
\x03
While it'll be some time before you can go home, eventually a chance for you to meet with me personally will happen.\b
\x00
Now before you wake up, go into a deep sleep.\b
May you continue gazing into a dream...
