Fufufu Sorry for waking you from your usual
sleep.\b
\x00
It's been a while.\b
I watched you play an active role in
everything.\b
\x03
I'm glad I brought you along.\b
\x01
However, Gensokyo is very wide and
expansive.\b
There are many places you haven't visited
and areas that have changed as well.\b
\x00
When you wake up, it might be a good idea to
travel around some more.\b
\x03
It'll be some time before you can go home,
but a chance for you to meet with me
personally will happen eventually.\b
\x00
Now, go into a deep sleep.\b
May you continue gazing into a dream...
