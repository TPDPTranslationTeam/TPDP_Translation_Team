Welcome.
Looks like you're finally here.\b
\x00
Oh, you didn't think I knew?\b
I can see everything in this world.\b
Anyway, what is your purpose for being here?\b
\x04
...The Puppet Incident?\b
\x05
Ah, so they went over there too, huh?\b
\x00
My world wasn't cute enough, so I made some
dolls.\b
\x05
However... I kinda made too many.\b
Then, before anyone realized, they all
started moving on their own...\b
\x03
But hey, they're cute, so it's fine the way
it is.\b
\x00
...It's troublesome, you say?\b
Even though they're so cute?\b
\x04
And since the barrier is loose, it's causing
problems?\b
\x02
Hm... Well, I can stop it, but that depends
solely on you.\b
\x03
You know what that means, right?
