Welcome.
Looks like you're finally here.\b
\x00
Oh you didn't think I knew?\b
I can see everything in this world.\b
Anyway what is your purpose for being here?\b
\x04
...The Puppet Incident?\b
\x05
Ah, so they went over there too huh?\b
\x00
Recently my world hasn't been cute enough, so I just made some dolls.\b
\x05
However I kinda made too much.\b
Moreover before anyone noticed, they all started moving on their own...\b
\x03
But hey, they're cute so it's fine the way it is.\b
\x00
It's troublesome you say?\b
Even though they're so cute?\b
\x04
And since the barrier is loose, it's causing problems?\b
\x02
Hm... Well I can stop it, but that depends solely on you.\b
\x03
Come on, you know what that means?
