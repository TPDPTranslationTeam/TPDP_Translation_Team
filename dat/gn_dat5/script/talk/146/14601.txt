Seems like I lost.\b
\x00
I guess I need to deepen my relationship
with my dolls.\b
\x03
Fufufu, I'm glad it was so fun for you.\b
I, too, had a lot of fun.\b
\cThough I hate to part with you, I'm
gonna do as you say.\b
\x05
A lot of energy is needed, so it'll take
some time.\b
Please be patient.\b
\x00
Now then, human from the outside world, it's
time for you to go home.\b
Just close your eyes...
