Oh, \p!\b
Sorry for calling you all of a sudden.\b
\x02
Apparently, the Puppet Liberation Front is 
running wild again.\b
\b
\cMoreover, not only playing pranks, they're 
actually harming others this time.\b 
The damage will become worse if we leave 
them alone.\b
\x01
You've disbanded the Front before.\b 
You should be the one to do it again.\b
Please punish them.\b

I heard the Front often appears around the 
village.\b
\x01
If you're going out to deal with them, I 
suggest that you prepare yourself.\b
Their pranks are getting much meaner than 
before.
