Oh! You understand, so you're taking my 
request!\b
Thanks, \p, 
you're such a reasonable person!\b
\x00
Right here is the Inflatable Boat.\b
When you need to use it, go into your bag 
and select it from Key Items.\b
\cAs long as you have this, you can move 
over almost any body of water.\b
It's a necessary item for humans climbing 
the mountain since they can't fly!\b
\x03
An important item for you, right, 
\p?\b
\x00
There! Now all preparations are complete.\b
I have high hopes for you.\b
\x03
As a sworn comrade, you gotta make sure you 
get it back, okay?\b
You going and bringing my stuff back to me 
is a big enough thanks already!\b
\x00
Oh, that's right! Since the Tengu Village 
is halfway up the mountain, it's a bit easy 
to miss.\b
\x03
I know it's a bit hard to understand, but 
if you search well enough, you should be 
able to find the entrance.
