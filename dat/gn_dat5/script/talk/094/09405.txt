Oh! You understand so you're taking my request!\b
Thanks \p, you're such an understanding person!\b

Right here is the Inflatable Boat.\b
When you need to use it, go into your bag and select it from Key Items.\b
\cAs long as you have this, you can move over almost any body of water.\b
A necessary item for humans climbing the mountain since you can't fly!\b
\x03
An important item for you, right \p?
\x00
There! Now all preparations are complete.
I have high hopes for you.\b
\x03
As a sworn comrade, you gotta make sure you get it back right?\b
You going and bringing my stuff back to me is a big enough thanks already!\b

I know it's a bit hard to understand, but if you search well enough you should find the entrance.
