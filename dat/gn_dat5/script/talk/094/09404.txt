...So according to what you're saying, 
\p, the Three Fairies of Light 
stole my optical camouflage, huh.\b
Then, to make matters worse, they went off 
to the Tengu Village to cause trouble.\b
\x02
Hrm, well, I'm gonna have to ask for your 
help with this,\b 
but do you mind getting my optical 
camouflage back?\b
\cIt's a big problem that my kappa tech is 
being used for mischief in the Tengu 
Village.\b
\x00
I'll even give you something good for it, 
\p!
