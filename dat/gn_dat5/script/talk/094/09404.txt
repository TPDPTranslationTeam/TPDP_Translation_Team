... So according to what you're saying, \p, the Three Fairies of Light stole my optical camouflage, huh.\b
Then, to make matters worse, they went off to the Tengu Village to cause trouble.\b

Hrm, well, I'm gonna have to ask for your help on this,\b but do you mind getting my optical camouflage back?\b
\cIt's a big issue that my Kappa tech is being used for mischief in the Tengu Village.\b

I'll even give you something good, \p!
