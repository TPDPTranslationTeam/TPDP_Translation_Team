Huh... How many times have I met you like
this?\b I'm seeing you everywhere I go.\b
\x05
The incident isn't over, you know?\b
We must cut it down at the source.\b
\x02
You've noticed from traveling about, haven't
you?\b Each kind of Puppet tends to stay in
one area.\b
\x05
They're supposed to have small habitats.\b
If they're born in Makai and came here, they
shouldn't spread so much.\b
\x10
But they all appeared everywhere at the same
time.\b Not only Gensokyo, but in the
Netherworld and in Heaven.\b
\x05
...Did the Puppets really started moving on
their own?\b I can only think that someone
started this for their own amusement.\b
\x09
I was about to cover up your consequences,
but to no surprise, I met you.\b
\x07
I won't give up on this.\b
Solving incidents is MY job.
