In the Puppet Exhibition, you will test your skills as a Puppeteer!
Try to win as many battles as you can.\b
\cYou can't use more than one of the same Puppet if the styles are the same.
Same thing with held items, so more than one of the same item isn't allowed.\b
You can't use items yourself during the tournament, either.\b
\cPuppets will have their levels decreased to 50 if greater than that.
Lower-leveled puppets will keep their levels, though.\b
\x03
\cIf you do really well, I'll give out gifts!
We're preparing them as we speak, so please join soon!
