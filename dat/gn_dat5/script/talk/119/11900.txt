I knew you'd chase after me.\b
Hmm? Why cause so much trouble 
when we all love Puppets so much?\b
\x01
Up until now, the one's that were 
showing them so much love were not humans.\b
These Puppets think so too.\b
They hate being treated like tools.\b
\x02
I understand those painful feelings.\b
\x05
That's why I must liberate these Puppets
from humans!!
