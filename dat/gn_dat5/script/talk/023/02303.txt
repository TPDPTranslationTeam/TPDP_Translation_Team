If you already have six Puppets in
your party, any new Puppets
obtained will be stored in this box.\b
\x06
You can open it and swap out Puppets
in the box with those in your party.\b
\x00
You can access the box by
interacting with the Akyuu Puppets
that you'll find on your adventure. \b

That's all I've got for you.
Good luck on your trip!
