You can use these to "seal" a wild Puppet.
It'll join you after you defeat it if it
is "sealed"!\b
\x00
Let me read the manual for you.\b
\o
\s
"During a wild Puppet battle, you may
use a Seal Thread from the battle menu.\b
This will cause the Puppet to be 'sealed'.\b
A wild Puppet that is sealed will join you
after it is defeated.\b
However, you cannot use Seal Threads on
Puppets that are owned by others."\b
