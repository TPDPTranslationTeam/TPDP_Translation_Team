Oh, you're that Puppeteer.\b
I've heard rumors of you 
from around the village.\b
\x01
First thing's first, though. There's 
something I'd like you to hear.\b
Right now, something troublesome 
is happening in Eientei.\b
\x04
I was supposed to be the one to help with 
the situation, but right now I'm kind of 
caught up in other matters...\b
\x02
I know that I'm asking for a lot from
you, but could you please 
help resolve this in my stead?\b

How about it?\b
I think fixing this little problem will 
put you one step closer to solving 
the bigger incident ahead.\b
\x03
Are you up for it?
