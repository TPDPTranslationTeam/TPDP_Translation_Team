I was scolded by my master...\b
I just wanted to play with Puppets!\b

...By the way, about those fairies,
they're not done playing with you.\b
\cYou should play with them again if you have 
some time to spare.\b
I'll lend you my torch's light if you're not
satisfied with their strength.\b
\c...Hm? What about me?\b
