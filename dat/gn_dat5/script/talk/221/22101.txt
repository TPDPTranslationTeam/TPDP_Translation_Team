Really? I'm saved!\b
\x01
I need you to search for the Peach Hairpin, the Dog Whistle, the Monkey Seat, and the Way of the Knife.\b
\x02
èAs for the locations... I'm not sure.
They are scattered around Gensokyo.\b
\x00
It's probably a lot of trouble to find them, so take your time looking.\b
Please come back when you find them all!\b
\x03
I'll thank you properly once you've found them.
