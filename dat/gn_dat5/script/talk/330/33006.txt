I think it's too fun to end it so soon.\b
\x00
Well, I'll give you a clue for the incident as a spoil of war.\b

But I don't spoil too much for you.\b

The party's over.
I'm going back to where I should be.\b
\x03
Have you ever heard of Reimaden?\b
That's like my home.\b

We might see each other again sometime.\b
I'm looking forward to it.
