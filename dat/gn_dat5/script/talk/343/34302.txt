Oh, it's you.\b
Did you find the culprit?\b
\x04
You found a Puppet of the 
Fairy Herald of Spring and you repelled it?\b

Oh... That's why cherry 
blossoms were blooming everywhere.\b
What a troublesome fairy, isn't she?\b

I've got plenty of free time now!\b
\x07
I'll win for sure 
when I battle you next time!\b
See ya, \p!
