Battling with you is always fun, though.\b

Please come again sometime.\b
I would like to have more duels with you.\b

See you then, outsider.\b
Don't disappoint me, okay?

~~It seems like she's asking the player to come back, rather than just suggesting it, so I added the please part to make it flow better. Also, her saying "once" was odd, as it seems that the player battles her multiple times; and has already battled her once before (which would make it "twice").
