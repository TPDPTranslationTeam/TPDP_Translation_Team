O-Oh, a vistor.\b
What a relief.\b
\x00
Ahem.\b
So what business do you have here?\b
Unfortunately, I am under orders to not
allow anyone to go through.\b 
\x02
...Huh? I was just sleeping before?\b

\x01
Eh! My explanation is fine!\b
Anyway, you can't pass through here.\b
If you insist on going through, you'll have
to beat me in battle first.
