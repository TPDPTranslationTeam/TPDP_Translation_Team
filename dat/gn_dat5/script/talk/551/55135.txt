Finally, you've come this far, \p.
How's the tournament?\b
\x00
No one's actions are dictated by intention,
nor are they forced to be by someone.\b
Communing, laughing, and battling with
Puppets together without any kind of
fetters.\b
\x03
Did you come to enjoy the scenery, that
is so much like a fantasy?\b
\x00
... mmm. Yes.
There's no point in exchanging words here.\b
\x01
Let us begin the beautiful, cruel, and
fantastical battle!
