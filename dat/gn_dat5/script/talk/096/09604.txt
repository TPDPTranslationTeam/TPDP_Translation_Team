This is a Superpower Glove.\b
If there is a rock in the way, you can 
smash it to bits with this item.\b
\x06
Select it from the "Key Items" part in the 
item menu and use it.\b
...or you could just look at the rock and 
smash it; your choice.\b

Oh, right.
There was a rock like that at the bottom of 
the mountain; you should go try out the 
glove on that.\b
\x03
Then it'll be much easier to get here.\b
It's very convenient, right?\b

That's right, Lady Kanako!\b
Worshipers can use it to easily come 
back!\b

Yes... Anyway, there's not much else to do 
but relax.
