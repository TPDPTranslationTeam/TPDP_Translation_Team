Alright. I'll read it.\b

\s
Seems like I was in a long, long dream.\b
In the land of fantasies, I had a journey with the puppet of fantasies, 
met the residents of fantasies, and then left the fantasy.\b
\cAt first I was insecure and scared, but it was a fun journey to recall.\b
I feel lonely without them.\b
\cBut I will never forget them either.\b
Even though I wish I could meet them again...\b
\c...in the fantasies that will never end.\b
