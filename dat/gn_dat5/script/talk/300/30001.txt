I've also been researching the Puppets 
by checking old documents,\b
\x05
but I haven't seen anything like them...\b
As a result, I haven't really been able to 
find anything.\b
\x04
But, there was one book that had something 
in it about Puppets!\b
\x00
It must be somewhat new as it just 
arrived recently.\b
It was called "Part One", so logically, 
there must be more.\b
\x01
An unprecedented Puppet outbreak...\b
Books written about them...\b
and, they're new...\b
\x04
That can't all just be a coincidence.\b
\x05
...I just don't know the source or the 
author.\b
From what I understand, 
this could be some sort of youma book...\b
\o???
\s
Hmm...Don't joke about that.
