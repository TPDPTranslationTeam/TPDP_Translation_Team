Yes, indeed. I have some big news for you!
It appears that the Kappa Hideout is being occupied by the Puppet Liberation Front.\b
How about that? Did that news interest you?\b
\cFrom here, go down the bridge by edge of the lake, and then head left to reach Genbu Ravine.\b
Inside the cavern will be where the Hideout is located.\b
Until then, we shall meet again!
