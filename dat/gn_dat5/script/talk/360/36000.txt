Flandre

Oh, you finally came.\b
\cWelcome.\b
...You're \p, right?\b
\x05
I'm Flandre Scarlet.\b
I'm... the younger sister of Remilia.\b
\x04
I was here, alone, for 495 years.\b
Everyone who plays with me breaks so easily. 
I like playing alone, though.\b
\x00
Sister told me \p is somewhat 
durable.
