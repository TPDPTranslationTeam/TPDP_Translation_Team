Since you haven't decided where to go, I recommend you go to Kourindou.\b
\cIf you ask, he'll prepare some tools which may somehow be useful to you on your journey.\b

When you head west from the human village, eventually you'll come upon the Forest of Magic.\b
In front of that is Kourndou.\b
\x03
Please be careful on your travels.
