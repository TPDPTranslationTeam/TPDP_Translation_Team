I've already got an explanation written up
on how to use it.\b
\x00
...Hm? The Scarlet Devil Mansion?\b
\x00
I see, so you heard about it from Alice.\b
\x02
However, there's some troublesome trees over
there that you'll need to cut down,\b
\x00
but I already lent my tree cutter to the
Eientei youkai.\b
\x03
I'm sure they are done with it by now. If
you want, you can try asking them for it.\b
\x00
It would be best to ask the half-youkai
elementary teacher in the Human Village on
how to get to Eientei.\b
She's well informed about that area
after all.\b

Well, good luck on your adventure.
