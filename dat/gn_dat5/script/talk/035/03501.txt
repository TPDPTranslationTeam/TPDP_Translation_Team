I've already got an explanation written up on how to use it.\b

Hm? The Scarlet Devil Mansion?\b
\x00

\x02
However, there's some troublesome trees over there that'll need to be cut down.\b
\x00
I did make a deal with the Eientei youkai before when I sold them the tree cutter.\b
\x03
I guess their task is over now, so how about asking them to borrow the tree cutter?\b
\x00
It would be a good idea to ask the half-youkai elementary teacher in the human village on how to get to Eientei.\b
She's well informed about that area after all.\b 
\x03
Well, good luck on your adventure. I'll be supporting you.\b
