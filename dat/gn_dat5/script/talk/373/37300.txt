So it just so happens to be a human like you that's wandering astray around here.\b
What's up, here to kill some time by bullying me?\b

You got into the Liberation Front and you were looking for me?\b
\cStop lying why don't you.\b
There's no way something so stupid would happen!\b

I'm the one who disbanded the Liberation Front you know!\b
You were a foe, and now you're an ally?\b
I told you to leave me alone!\b

I'm gonna kindly return the favor!
