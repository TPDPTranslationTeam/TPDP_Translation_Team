Your timing is bad, \p.\b
I would love to welcome you, but right now isn't the time.\b
\x01
The reason being is that we're in the wake of a robbery that took place in the village.\b
\cEveryone is on edge, and just talking to someone will arouse suspicion and start a Puppet Battle.\b
\x02
Even if I don't search for the criminal, my important brush for news coverage was taken.\b
\x01
While I hate to say this, but you don't have any relationship to this crime do you?\b
\x02
I understand that it is rude to suspect you like this but without my brush I won't be able to do news coverage.\b
\x00
I will investigate every nook and cranny!
