You certainly seem up to the task.\b

This seems alright.\b
Now come and offer me a hand, \p.\b

Your job will be to mediate a quarrel 
between our princess and another person.\b
\x02
If it were just the princess this would've 
already been dealt with but,\b

I'd like you to stop one of them.\b

While you are preparing, I shall move on 
ahead.\b
Until then, thank you for your cooperation.
