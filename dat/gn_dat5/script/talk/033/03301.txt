I've got it!\b
I'll give you this latest model bicycle!\b
Surely it'll be helpful on your adventure.\b
\x04
... Well, I'd also like you
to run an errand for me too.\b
\x00
In the forest up ahead there's a girl
named Alice who wants a package delivered.\b
\x06
It did take some time to get the
right repairs done on the bike,\b
but you should be able to
get there in no time.\b
\x00
Also...\b
\x03
Alice is the best person you
could learn about dolls from.\b
Isn't that great for you too?
