//そういえば 今回のは慧音のお使いなんだろ？\b
You were asked to run an errand by Keine, right?\b
//なら 紅魔館に行く前に寺子屋によっていくといい。\b
You should go see her in her class before you go to the Scarlet Devil Mansion.\b
\x03
//アイツは義理堅いから 何かくれるかもしれないしな。\b
She's trustworthy, I'm sure she'll give you something in return.\b
\x07
//今度こそ行くぜ。じゃあな。
I'm going for real now. See ya.

//[Terakoya] part should be replaced with proper translated word
*I replaced "dutiful" with "trustworthy" because it didn't make any sense. I'm assuming she was saying that she would repay the favor, but dutiful doesn't make sense for that
