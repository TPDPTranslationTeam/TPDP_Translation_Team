What a surprise to see you here, \p.\b
\x07
I've been hearing all kinds of things about 
you lately.\b
It sounds like you're making great progress.\b
\x03
You helped out with Eintei, right?\b
\x05
...Hm, you were asked to go on an errand by 
Keine?\b
\x07
I figure you've gotten much stronger if 
Keine trusts you enough to run this errand 
for her.
