What? The incident may be happening
outside Gensokyo too?\b
And you're about to go to 
Makai through the mountain?\b
\x02
Ah... And Marisa is inspecting 
the Netherworld.\b 
\x05
Considering the source,
that may not entirely be wrong.\b
If you're going to Makai and Marisa 
is going to the Netherworld,
I guess I'll check out Heaven.\b
\x00
We'll be able to cover 
more ground if we split up.\b
If the source of the incident is in
Heaven, I can put a stop to it.\b
\x05
\p, if the source is in Makai,
I expect it to be solved 
by the time I get back.\b
I'm trusting you here. Don't disappoint me.
