I heard the circumstances from Yukari.\b
The creator of Makai made Puppets for fun and they started moving on their own.\b
What a troublesome story, huh?\b

But you punished her.\b

Great job.\b

We haven't yet noticed the Puppets' numbers decreasing, but someday they will.\b
\x06
You can return home soon!
Great job indeed!\b

You're staying here for a little longer, right?\b
\x07
Then I gotta train more to beat you!\b

Battling is okay, but please not inside.\b
