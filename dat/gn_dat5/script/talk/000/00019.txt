Your puppets have fully recovered!
~Consider player can be either male or female, I intentionally rephrased it to avoid third-person pronoun.
~~Seems unnecessary to have "you" at all; since you're resting, it's already assumed that the player is recovered or "rested". It's not assumed for puppets (as they aren't the ones resting). Revert if my logic is flawed.
