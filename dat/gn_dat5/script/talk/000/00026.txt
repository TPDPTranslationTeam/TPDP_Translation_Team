*\dの封印を解除するのね。\b
You'd like to break \d's seal,
right?\b
\x02
*封印を解除すると きっと二度と会えなくなるわ。\b
*やっぱり やめにしない？
You will never see this Puppet again
once the seal is broken.\b
Are you sure you want to do this?
~here I wonder what the UI is saying. In this case, "yes" would be cancel while "no" would be negation.
~~Needs testing??
