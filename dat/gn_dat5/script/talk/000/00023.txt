A human? It's quite rare to see your kind
hanging around here.\b
Did you lose your way?\b
\x03

So you're \p,\b
who is traveling all over the world\b
to find clues about the Puppet Incident.\b
~original scripts says "to solve," but "to find clues" seems more adequate to me.

Well, then.\b
I can break the seal of a Puppet for you.\b
~~"a Puppet" might make the player think that they can only do it once. Could be "Puppets" instead. Need second opinions/testing.
\x02

They will no longer be with you once you
break their seal.\b
\x00

If you really wish to break them,
you can come to me.\b
~~Since she's reluctant to do it, her saying "please" seems odd.

\x01
However, just because I can,
doesn't mean I'm glad to do so.
