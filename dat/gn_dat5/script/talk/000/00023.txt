*あら。こんなところに人間なんて珍しいわね。
A human? It's quite rare to see your kind
hanging around here.
*迷い込んじゃったのかしら？\b
Did you lose your way?
\x03
*へぇ \pさん というのね。\b
So you are \p,
*人形の異変を解決するために 各地を巡っていると。\b
who is traveling all over the world 
to find clues about the Puppet Incident.\b
~original scripts says "to solve," but "to find clues" seems more adequate to me.
\x
*それなら・・・\b
Well, then.\b
*\c私は 人形の封印の解除ができるの。\b
I can break the seal of a Puppet for you.\b
~~"a puppet" might make the player think that they can only do it once. Could be "puppets" instead. Need second opinions/testing.
\x02
*封印を解除した人形とは 二度と会えなくなってしまうけど・・・\b
They will no longer be with you once you
break the their seal.\b
\x00
*もし どうしても人形の封印を解除したくなったら 私のところへいらっしゃい。\b
If you really wish to break them,
you can come to me.\b
~~Since she's reluctant to do it, her saying "please" seems odd.
\x01
*あまり 頼ってほしくはないのだけどね。
However, just because I can,
doesn't mean I'm glad to do so.
