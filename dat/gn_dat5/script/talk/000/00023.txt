A human? It's quite rare to see your kind
hanging around here.\b
Did you lose your way?\b
\x03
So you're \p,\b
who is traveling all over Gensokyo\b
to find clues about the Puppet Incident.\b
\x
Well then,\b
I can break the seals of Puppets for you.\b
\x02
They will no longer be with you once you
break their seals.\b
\x00
If you really wish to break them,
you can come to me.\b
\x01
However, just because I can,
doesn't mean I'm glad to do so.
